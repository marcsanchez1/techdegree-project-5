## An Interactive Photo Gallery

**Build the web page layout using HTML and CSS, using the layout in the gallery_mockup.png file.**
1. Create a gallery using the provided thumbnail images.
2. Create a search box field.
3. The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups.

**Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for a lightbox. This must include the following functionality and features:**
* The ability to click on thumbnail images in the gallery and view them in a lightbox.
* A background overlay that appears and covers the entire window when displaying a larger image.
* The ability to add text captions to each image in the lightbox.
* Back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
* Make sure there is a way to close the lightbox and return to the gallery view.
