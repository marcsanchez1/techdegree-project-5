## An Interactive Photo Gallery

**Build the web page layout using HTML and CSS, using the layout in the gallery_mockup.png file.**
* Create a gallery using the provided thumbnail images.
* Create a search box field.
* The design does not need to be exact, but the general spacing and arrangement of the elements should match the design of the mockups.

**Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for a lightbox. This must include the following functionality and features:**
* The ability to click on thumbnail images in the gallery and view them in a lightbox.
* A background overlay that appears and covers the entire window when displaying a larger image.
* The ability to add text captions to each image in the lightbox.
* Back and forward arrows to switch between photos when the lightbox is visible.
* Make sure there is a way to close the lightbox and return to the gallery view.

**Research, find and implement a jQuery plugin for the search box. This must include the following functionality and features:**
* The search box at the top of the page should filters photos based on the captions.
* The photos should filter in real-time as you type, and only display photos that match the search.

**Make sure to check your code is valid by running it through an HTML and CSS validator.**
* Links to the validators can be found in the Project Resources. This will help you spot any errors that might be in your code.
* **There are a few exceptions that you donâ€™t need to fix:**
